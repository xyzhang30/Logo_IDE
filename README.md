This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

### Timeline

 * Start Date: February 15, 2024

 * Finish Date: March 8, 2024

 * Hours Spent: 240 (20h per person on average per week for 3 weeks)



### Attributions

 * Resources used for learning (including AI assistance)
   * Javafx official documentation
   * The design patterns website used for lab in class
 
 * Resources used directly (including AI assistance)


### Running the Program

 * Main class: the main class is used to run the program

 * Data files needed: all files in the /data and /resources folder

 * Interesting data files: xml files for every command, sample .slogo code files.

 * Key/Mouse inputs: code ide takes in all keyboard letter/number input; all 4 arrow keys make turtle move without having to enter code.



### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:
   * Simplification: when you click on a command in the command history or help, you could technically also change the command name and it would also execute.

 * Known Bugs:
   * left and right turning are flipped in the frontend

 * Features implemented:
   * Basic commands, make variable, user history view, save/load history, user defined variables view, help, different ui themes, multiple work spaces, etc.

 * Features unimplemented:
   * replay animation, save preference, execute from user defined view

 * Noteworthy Features:
   * line animation, animation speed adjustment


### Assignment Impressions
* We as a group learned a lot about API design, design patterns, and unit testing from this project. This is the first time for most of us to ever actually put these concepts in practice, we learned a lot and there's definitely still a lot of space for improvement. I this the idea of this project is very interesting. I think it's very open for add-ons and variation of features. There are some interesting extensions that we didn't get to because of time constraints that I would want to work on during my own time.
