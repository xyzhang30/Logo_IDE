## Planning Questions

 * What behaviors (methods) should the Turtle have and what service should it provide?

 * When does parsing need to take place and what does it need to start properly?

 * What is the result of parsing (not the details of the algorithm) and who receives it?

 * When are errors detected and how are they reported?

 * What do different commands need to know, when do they know it, and how do they get it?

 * What behaviors does the result of a command need to have to be used by the View?Â 

 * How is the View updated after a command has completed execution?

 * What value would Controller(s) have in mediating between the Model and View?

### Backend Design CRCs

This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:
![Order Class CRC Card](order_crc_card.png "Order Class")

This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:

|Order| |
|---|---|
|boolean isInStock(OrderLine)         |OrderLine|
|double getTotalPrice(OrderLine)      |Customer|
|boolean isValidPayment (Customer)    | |
|void deliverTo (OrderLine, Customer) | |

This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:
```java
public class Order {
     // returns whether or not the given items are available to order
     public boolean isInStock (OrderLine items)
     // sums the price of all the given items
     public double getTotalPrice (OrderLine items)
     // returns whether or not the customer's payment is valid
     public boolean isValidPayment (Customer customer)
     // dispatches the items to be ordered to the customer's selected address
     public void deliverTo (OrderLine items, Customer customer)
 }
 ```

This class's purpose or value is to manage something:
```java
public class Something {
     // sums the numbers in the given data
     public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data)
	 // creates an order from the given data
     public Order makeOrder (String structuredData)
 }
```


### Frontend Design CRCs


This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:
![Order Class CRC Card](order_crc_card.png "Order Class")

This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:

|Order| |
|---|---|
|boolean isInStock(OrderLine)         |OrderLine|
|double getTotalPrice(OrderLine)      |Customer|
|boolean isValidPayment (Customer)    | |
|void deliverTo (OrderLine, Customer) | |

This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:
```java
public class Order {
     // returns whether or not the given items are available to order
     public boolean isInStock (OrderLine items)
     // sums the price of all the given items
     public double getTotalPrice (OrderLine items)
     // returns whether or not the customer's payment is valid
     public boolean isValidPayment (Customer customer)
     // dispatches the items to be ordered to the customer's selected address
     public void deliverTo (OrderLine items, Customer customer)
 }
 ```

This class's purpose or value is to manage something:
```java
public class Something {
     // sums the numbers in the given data
     public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data)
	 // creates an order from the given data
     public Order makeOrder (String structuredData)
 }
```



### Use Cases

 * The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, sees the turtle move in the display window leaving a trail, and has the command added to the environment's history.

 * The user types '50 fd' in the command window and sees an error message that the command was not formatted correctly.

 * The user types 'pu fd 50 pd fd 50' in the command window and sees the turtle move twice (once without a trail and once with a trail).

 * The user changes the color of the environment's background.
