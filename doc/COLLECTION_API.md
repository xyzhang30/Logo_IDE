## In your experience using these collections, are they hard or easy to use?
Mostly easy to use.


## In your experience using these collections, do you feel mistakes are easy to avoid?
It depends on the mistake; syntax can be tricky but otherwise mistakes are generally easy to avoid. 


## What methods are common to all collections (except Maps)?
add, addALl, remove, clear, contains, isEmpty, size


## What methods are common to all Deques?
addFirst, addLast, removeFirst, removeLast, getFirst, getLast


## What is the purpose of each interface implemented by LinkedList?
List: creates an ordered collection
Cloneable: class can implement clone
Iterable: object is target of enhanced for statement

## How many different implementations are there for a Set?
There are nine different implementations for a set. Yes because there is a significant amount of implementations; many classes implement this.

## What is the purpose of each superclass of PriorityQueue?
AbstractionCollection: provides skeletal implementations of queue operations after specifying an iterator and size- add, remove, offer, poll, peak
AbstractQueue: add remove an element based off offer, poll, and peak


## What is the purpose of the Collections utility class?
It provides utility methods.
The point of this is to prevent List from becoming overly complicated.
Some repeated elements are sorting and addAll.
It is normally better to use methods for the specific collection (List).
